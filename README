This IntelliJ IDEA plugin is intended to simplify work with automated tests in Maven projects.

Current features:
* Action "Show Test Results" that shows results of Surefire and Failsafe tests
* Manual refreshing and auto-refreshing of test results

# Show Test Results action
Show Test Results window looks like IntelliJ's Junit test results panel.

In order to view test results for maven module:
1. right click the module
2. choose Show Test Results action

The plugin looks for target/surefire-reports and target/failsafe-reports directories where test results are stored.
